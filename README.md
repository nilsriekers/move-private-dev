# Moove

Moove (Marking Online using Only the Onsets of Vocal Elements) is a novel tool for real-time syllable segmentation and classification of birdsong, designed to enable closed-loop experiments in vocal learning research. Designed to study the learned vocalisations of Bengalese finches, Moove identifies target syllables in a bird's song and provides feedback in real time. Moove provides an out-of-the-box, neural network-based approach to reliably target vocal syllables before their end, enabling a reinforcement protocol where a specific syllable can be targeted with aversive white noise or an alternative feedback stimulus if adjusted.

Moove uses a two-stage architecture: a convolutional-based encoder that segments syllables in the audio signal and a CNN classifier that assigns each detected syllable segment a label, identifying its type based on the initial part of its structure. This design allows Moove to operate at a lower audio chunk duration than other tools, enabling faster and more accurate syllable recognition with minimal latency. Moove includes a GUI for creating training datasets using unsupervised methods and training the networks, as well as a recording script for real-time syllable targeting.

## Installation

### Quick start (recommended)

The fastest way to get Moove running. Requires Python 3.9–3.12 and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/veitlab/moove.git
cd moove
uv sync
uv run moovegui        # GUI for datasets & training
uv run moovetaf        # real-time recording & targeting
```

If you do not have `uv` yet:
```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Windows (PowerShell)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

### With pip

```bash
pip install moove
```

or for a specific version:
```bash
pip install moove==1.0.3
```

After installing, a default configuration file (`moove_config.ini`) will be available at `~/.moove/`. This configuration file should be adjusted to fit your experiment setup.

### PortAudio Installation

Moove uses the `sounddevice` library, which depends on PortAudio. On most systems, PortAudio is already available or bundled. If needed, follow the steps below to install it:

#### Windows
PortAudio is bundled with `sounddevice` on Windows -- no extra installation needed.

#### macOS
Install PortAudio via Homebrew before installing Moove:
```bash
brew install portaudio
```

#### Linux (Debian / Ubuntu)
Install the PortAudio development library:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-dev gcc portaudio19-dev
```

### Enabling ASIO Support (Windows)

ASIO provides the lowest latency, which is critical for Moove's real-time targeting capabilities.

**Modern method** (sounddevice >= 0.5): set the environment variable before starting Moove:
```powershell
$env:SD_ENABLE_ASIO = "1"
moovegui
```

**Legacy method**: replace the default PortAudio DLL manually:
- Locate `libportaudio64bit.dll` in your `sounddevice` installation's `_sounddevice_data/portaudio-binaries/` folder
- If `libportaudio64bit-ASIO.dll` exists alongside it: delete the non-ASIO DLL and rename the ASIO version
- If only the non-ASIO DLL exists: download the ASIO-enabled binary from https://github.com/spatialaudio/portaudio-binaries and replace the existing file

## Configuration

### Default Configuration Location

By default, Moove stores its configuration file (`moove_config.ini`) in `~/.moove/`. This configuration file should be adjusted to fit your experiment setup.

### Custom Configuration Directory

To store the configuration in a different location, use the `MOOVE_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable:

**Windows:**
```cmd
set MOOVE_CONFIG_DIR=D:\moove_config
moovegui
```

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
export MOOVE_CONFIG_DIR="/path/to/config"
moovegui
```

## Usage

Once installed, Moove offers two main entry points:

- `moovegui`: Opens the GUI for creating labeled datasets and training the segmentation and classification networks.
- `moovetaf`: Starts the recording and targeting application, enabling real-time targeting of specific syllables.

To start, simply type `moovegui` or `moovetaf` in the terminal. When using uv:
```bash
uv run moovegui
uv run moovetaf
```

### Requirements

- Python 3.9 -- 3.12 (3.11 recommended)
- Audio hardware: a microphone and speaker setup is required for online targeting experiments

### Troubleshooting

**PortAudio / sounddevice errors:**

Ensure PortAudio is installed on your system (see Installation above). On Linux: `sudo apt install portaudio19-dev`. On macOS: `brew install portaudio`.

**GUI not starting:**

Make sure you have a display server available. On headless Linux systems, PyQt6 requires an X11 or Wayland session.

**NumPy compatibility:**

Moove works with both NumPy 1.x and 2.x. If you encounter unexpected errors with NumPy 2.x, try `pip install "numpy<2"`.

### Workflow Overview

1. **Baseline Recordings** -- Begin with baseline recordings using MooveTaf. In the configuration file, set `realtime_classification` to `False` and configure `dB_threshold` for bout detection.

2. **Manual Segmentation** -- In MooveGUI, use the Resegmentation Window to manually segment recorded songs.

3. **Train the Segmentation Network** -- With the segmentation data, open the Training Window to train the segmentation network. Then return to the Resegmentation Window for automated re-segmentation.

4. **Label Creation** -- Use the Cluster Window in the GUI to label syllable segments. Clusters can be automatically labeled and then manually adjusted.

5. **Train the Classification Network** -- With labeled syllables, use the Training Window to train the classification network.

6. **Real-Time Targeting** -- Update the configuration file with the trained model names, set `realtime_classification` to `True`, and specify the target syllable. MooveTaf is now ready for real-time targeting experiments.

A detailed guide is available in the `docs/` folder and can be built with Sphinx:
```bash
cd docs
sphinx-build -b html source build/html
open build/html/index.html
```
